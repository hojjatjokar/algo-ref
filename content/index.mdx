# What is this documnet about

It's about learning Algorithms and all you need for it.

## Process

1. Big picture of topic
2. Scope: The basics

- [ ] Big O
- [ ] Problem solving steps
- [ ] multiple pointer
- [ ] sliding window
- [ ] divide and conquer
- [ ] frequency counter
- [ ] recursion
- [ ] searching
- [ ] sorting

3. Success criteria

- [ ] Measure time and space complexity
- [ ] Can use basics to solve basic problems
- [ ] Understand basic techniques and use them
- [ ] Understand basic algorithms and use them

4. Find resources: [resources file](https://algo.hojjat.dev/resources)

5. : Create a learning plan: Create all files and chapters. Config the order of them.

6. Filter resources: recommended resources
